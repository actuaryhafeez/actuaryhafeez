# Digits Recognition App using k-NN and Streamlit

This project is an interactive web application that recognizes handwritten digits using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and Streamlit. The app allows users to draw a digit on the screen and get a prediction for the corresponding digit from 0 to 9.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Overview

The project is based on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which includes 70,000 images of size 28x28 pixels. The k-NN algorithm is used to train a model on the dataset and predict the digit labels. The app uses a Streamlit interface to allow users to draw a digit on the screen, preprocess the image, and feed it to the k-NN model to get a prediction.

## Features

The app includes the following features:

- Interactive drawing canvas to draw digits with the mouse or touchpad
- Preprocessing of the image to normalize the pixel values and center the digit
- Prediction of the digit label using the k-NN model
- Display of the predicted digit label and its probability score

## Usage

To use the app, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Draw a digit on the canvas using the mouse or touchpad.
5. Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted digit label and its probability score.

## Future Improvements

Some possible improvements for the app include:

- Using a more complex machine learning model to improve accuracy
- Adding support for recognizing multiple digits in the same image
- Deploying the app to a web server for online access
- Adding more features to the user interface, such as color selection and brush size control
